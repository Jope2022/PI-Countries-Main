You may optionally specify it\n * to hydrate the state from the server in universal apps, or to restore a\n * previously serialized user session.\n * If you use `combineReducers` to produce the root reducer function, this must be\n * an object with the same shape as `combineReducers` keys.\n *\n * @param {Function} [enhancer] The store enhancer. You may optionally specify it\n * to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware,\n * time travel, persistence, etc. The only store enhancer that ships with Redux\n * is `applyMiddleware()`.\n *\n * @returns {Store} A Redux store that lets you read the state, dispatch actions\n * and subscribe to changes.\n */\nexport const legacy_createStore = createStore\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,OAAOA,YAAY,MAAM,2BAA2B;AAEpD,OAAOC,WAAW,MAAM,qBAAqB;AAC7C,OAAOC,aAAa,MAAM,uBAAuB;AACjD,SAASC,MAAM,QAAQ,gBAAgB;;AAEvC;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,OAAO,SAASC,WAAWA,CAACC,OAAO,EAAEC,cAAc,EAAEC,QAAQ,EAAE;EAC7D,IACG,OAAOD,cAAc,KAAK,UAAU,IAAI,OAAOC,QAAQ,KAAK,UAAU,IACtE,OAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,UAAU,IAAI,OAAOC,SAAS,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC,KAAK,UAAW,EACtE;IACA,MAAM,IAAIC,KAAK,CACb,2DAA2D,GACzD,8DAA8D,GAC9D,6IAA6I,CAChJ;EACH;EAEA,IAAI,OAAOH,cAAc,KAAK,UAAU,IAAI,OAAOC,QAAQ,KAAK,WAAW,EAAE;IAC3EA,QAAQ,GAAGD,cAAc;IACzBA,cAAc,GAAGI,SAAS;EAC5B;EAEA,IAAI,OAAOH,QAAQ,KAAK,WAAW,EAAE;IACnC,IAAI,OAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,UAAU,EAAE;MAClC,MAAM,IAAIE,KAAK,CACZ,+DAA8DN,MAAM,CACnEI,QAAQ,CACR,GAAE,CACL;IACH;IAEA,OAAOA,QAAQ,CAACH,WAAW,CAAC,CAACC,OAAO,EAAEC,cAAc,CAAC;EACvD;EAEA,IAAI,OAAOD,OAAO,KAAK,UAAU,EAAE;IACjC,MAAM,IAAII,KAAK,CACZ,mEAAkEN,MAAM,CACvEE,OAAO,CACP,GAAE,CACL;EACH;EAEA,IAAIM,cAAc,GAAGN,OAAO;EAC5B,IAAIO,YAAY,GAAGN,cAAc;EACjC,IAAIO,gBAAgB,GAAG,EAAE;EACzB,IAAIC,aAAa,GAAGD,gBAAgB;EACpC,IAAIE,aAAa,GAAG,KAAK;;EAEzB;AACF;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACE,SAASC,4BAA4BA,CAAA,EAAG;IACtC,IAAIF,aAAa,KAAKD,gBAAgB,EAAE;MACtCC,aAAa,GAAGD,gBAAgB,CAACI,KAAK,EAAE;IAC1C;EACF;;EAEA;AACF;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACE,SAASC,QAAQA,CAAA,EAAG;IAClB,IAAIH,aAAa,EAAE;MACjB,MAAM,IAAIN,KAAK,CACb,oEAAoE,GAClE,6DAA6D,GAC7D,yEAAyE,CAC5E;IACH;IAEA,OAAOG,YAAY;EACrB;;EAEA;AACF;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACE,SAASO,SAASA,CAACC,QAAQ,EAAE;IAC3B,IAAI,OAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,UAAU,EAAE;MAClC,MAAM,IAAIX,KAAK,CACZ,+DAA8DN,MAAM,CACnEiB,QAAQ,CACR,GAAE,CACL;IACH;IAEA,IAAIL,aAAa,EAAE;MACjB,MAAM,IAAIN,KAAK,CACb,qEAAqE,GACnE,sFAAsF,GACtF,oFAAoF,GACpF,wEAAwE,CAC3E;IACH;IAEA,IAAIY,YAAY,GAAG,IAAI;IAEvBL,4BAA4B,EAAE;IAC9BF,aAAa,CAACQ,IAAI,CAACF,QAAQ,CAAC;IAE5B,OAAO,SAASG,WAAWA,CAAA,EAAG;MAC5B,IAAI,CAACF,YAAY,EAAE;QACjB;MACF;MAEA,IAAIN,aAAa,EAAE;QACjB,MAAM,IAAIN,KAAK,CACb,gFAAgF,GAC9E,wEAAwE,CAC3E;MACH;MAEAY,YAAY,GAAG,KAAK;MAEpBL,4BAA4B,EAAE;MAC9B,MAAMQ,KAAK,GAAGV,aAAa,CAACW,OAAO,CAACL,QAAQ,CAAC;MAC7CN,aAAa,CAACY,MAAM,CAACF,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,CAAC;MAC9BX,gBAAgB,GAAG,IAAI;IACzB,CAAC;EACH;;EAEA;AACF;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACE,SAASc,QAAQA,CAACC,MAAM,EAAE;IACxB,IAAI,CAAC1B,aAAa,CAAC0B,MAAM,CAAC,EAAE;MAC1B,MAAM,IAAInB,KAAK,CACZ,iEAAgEN,MAAM,CACrEyB,MAAM,CACN,4UAA2U,CAC9U;IACH;IAEA,IAAI,OAAOA,MAAM,CAACC,IAAI,KAAK,WAAW,EAAE;MACtC,MAAM,IAAIpB,KAAK,CACb,4GAA4G,CAC7G;IACH;IAEA,IAAIM,aAAa,EAAE;MACjB,MAAM,IAAIN,KAAK,CAAC,oCAAoC,CAAC;IACvD;IAEA,IAAI;MACFM,aAAa,GAAG,IAAI;MACpBH,YAAY,GAAGD,cAAc,CAACC,YAAY,EAAEgB,MAAM,CAAC;IACrD,CAAC,SAAS;MACRb,aAAa,GAAG,KAAK;IACvB;IAEA,MAAMe,SAAS,GAAIjB,gBAAgB,GAAGC,aAAc;IACpD,KAAK,IAAIiB,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,EAAEA,CAAC,GAAGD,SAAS,CAACE,MAAM,EAAED,CAAC,EAAE,EAAE;MACzC,MAAMX,QAAQ,GAAGU,SAAS,CAACC,CAAC,CAAC;MAC7BX,QAAQ,EAAE;IACZ;IAEA,OAAOQ,MAAM;EACf;;EAEA;AACF;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACE,SAASK,cAAcA,CAACC,WAAW,EAAE;IACnC,IAAI,OAAOA,WAAW,KAAK,UAAU,EAAE;MACrC,MAAM,IAAIzB,KAAK,CACZ,kEAAiEN,MAAM,CACtE+B,WAAW,CACX,EAAC,CACJ;IACH;IAEAvB,cAAc,GAAGuB,WAAW;;IAE5B;IACA;IACA;IACA;IACAP,QAAQ,CAAC;MAAEE,IAAI,EAAE5B,WAAW,CAACkC;IAAQ,CAAC,CAAC;EACzC;;EAEA;AACF;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACE,SAASC,UAAUA,CAAA,EAAG;IACpB,MAAMC,cAAc,GAAGlB,SAAS;IAChC,OAAO;MACL;AACN;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;MACMA,SAASA,CAACmB,QAAQ,EAAE;QAClB,IAAI,OAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,QAAQ,IAAIA,QAAQ,KAAK,IAAI,EAAE;UACrD,MAAM,IAAIC,SAAS,CAChB,8DAA6DpC,MAAM,CAClEmC,QAAQ,CACR,GAAE,CACL;QACH;QAEA,SAASE,YAAYA,CAAA,EAAG;UACtB,IAAIF,QAAQ,CAACG,IAAI,EAAE;YACjBH,QAAQ,CAACG,IAAI,CAACvB,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC;UAC3B;QACF;QAEAsB,YAAY,EAAE;QACd,MAAMjB,WAAW,GAAGc,cAAc,CAACG,YAAY,CAAC;QAChD,OAAO;UAAEjB;QAAY,CAAC;MACxB,CAAC;MAED,CAACvB,YAAY,IAAI;QACf,OAAO,IAAI;MACb;IACF,CAAC;EACH;;EAEA;EACA;EACA;EACA2B,QAAQ,CAAC;IAAEE,IAAI,EAAE5B,WAAW,CAACyC;EAAK,CAAC,CAAC;EAEpC,OAAO;IACLf,QAAQ;IACRR,SAAS;IACTD,QAAQ;IACRe,cAAc;IACd,CAACjC,YAAY,GAAGoC;EAClB,CAAC;AACH;;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,OAAO,MAAMO,kBAAkB,GAAGvC,WAAW"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
